        <h2>Feature-Specific Questions</h2>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question">How is the productivity score calculated?</button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>The productivity score is calculated as a percentage of your Productive time compared to your total tracked time (Productive + Unproductive + Neutral). For example, if you spend 60 minutes on Productive sites out of a total of 100 minutes, your score will be 60%.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question">What do "Productive," "Unproductive," and "Neutral" times mean?</button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>- <strong>Productive:</strong> Time spent on websites you've categorized as productive (e.g., docs.google.com, work-related sites).<br>
               - <strong>Unproductive:</strong> Time spent on websites you've categorized as unproductive (e.g., facebook.com, social media).<br>
               - <strong>Neutral:</strong> Time spent on websites that aren't categorized as either productive or unproductive.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question">Why are times shown in minutes, hours, or days?</button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>To make the stats easier to read, FocusFlow AI automatically converts times to the most appropriate unit. If the time is less than 60 minutes, it's shown in minutes (e.g., 45 min). If it's 60 minutes or more, it's shown in hours (e.g., 2 hr 30 min). If it's 1440 minutes (24 hours) or more, it's shown in days (e.g., 2 d).</p>

        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question">What does the pie chart show?</button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>The pie chart visually represents your time distribution across Productive, Unproductive, and Neutral categories for the selected period (Today, Yesterday, or All Time). Each segment's size reflects the proportion of time spent in that category.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question">How do I categorize websites as Productive or Unproductive?</button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Click the Settings button (‚öôÔ∏è) in the popup to open the Settings page. There, you can add websites to the Productive or Unproductive lists by entering their domains (e.g., docs.google.com for Productive, facebook.com for Unproductive). Any website not in these lists is considered Neutral by default.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question">How do the productivity tips work?</button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>FocusFlow AI provides personalized tips based on your productivity score. If your score is low (e.g., under 10%), you'll see tips to reduce distractions, like blocking unproductive sites. If your score is high (e.g., over 80%), you'll get tips to maintain your habits. Tips are displayed in the popup and can be toggled on or off.</p>
